      <h1>Race in UC Admissions</h1>
        <p class="text-uppercase">by <a href="http://sahilchinoy.github.io" target="_blank">Sahil Chinoy</a> &middot; August 2014</p>
        
        <hr>

      <p class="lead">In 2014, the University of California <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/21/latino-white-uc-admissions_n_5187943.html" target="_blank">made news</a> by accepting more Latino than white applicants, a first since the university's founding almost a century and a half ago.</p>
      <p>Race is a common theme in dialogue about the university's application and admission process. Debate over affirmative action still seems fresh, especially after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Constitutional_Amendment_No.5" target="_blank">SCA 5</a>, a failed effort to overturn California's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_209" target="_blank">Proposition 209</a>, which banned consideration of race in the university's selection process. The passage of Prop. 209 in 1996 prompted a decrease in the number of black and Latino students admitted to the university, the legacy of which is still felt at the university's 10 campuses today.</p>
      <p>Eighteen years later, we look back on almost 25 years of historical application and admissions <a href="#sources">data</a> to determine how the makeup of the university's student body has changed, tracking the evolution of answers to fundamental questions: <a href="#applying">Who applies</a> to the University of California? <a href="#admitted">Who gets in</a>?</p>

      <p class="lead">The racial breakdown of UC applicants and admitted students has changed dramatically since 1990, but it's largely kept pace with demographic shifts in California.</p>

      <p>In 1990, when whites made up 57 percent of California's population, about half of the UC's applicants were white. In 2014, only 39 percent of California's residents are white, and, similarly, only about 25 percent of UC applicants were.</p>
      <p>Recently, more Hispanic students are applying and getting in. Though they made up 26 percent of California's population in 1990, they represented only 13 percent of UC applicants. In 2014, Hispanics made up 33 percent of UC applicants &mdash; more than any other group.</p>
      <p>Black applicants have made more modest gains: They made up about 7 percent of the population in 1990 but less than 5 percent of applicants, while in 2014, they represented about 6 percent of the population and 6 percent of applicants.</p>
      <p>Asian students have made up a disproportionately large section of the applicant pool since 1990, when they were already more than 25 percent of applicants. They have since grown to over 30 percent of applicants.</p>
      <p>According to state graduation data, Asians were the only racial group that represented more of the UC applicant pool than of high school graduates (by 18 percent) in 2009. Hispanic students, in particular, made up far less of the applicants than graduates &mdash; five years later, however, this difference is less dramatic.</p>

      <p>Much of the change in the breakdown of UC applicants, then, has occurred as Hispanic students made up more of each year's high school graduates and applied to the university in greater numbers. White students have seen the opposite trend, while Asians have applied in consistently high proportions. </p>

      <h3 id="admitted">Who's getting in?</h3>
      <p class="lead">Asian students are accepted at greater rates than other races, particularly Hispanic and black students, a trend which has become more pronounced over time.</p>

    <p>The overall university admission rate has decreased dramatically in the last decades, from about 80 percent in 1990 to about 60 percent in 2014. Though each race's admission rate has roughly followed the yearly variations of the overall admission rate, the difference between the races with the highest and lowest admission rates is significant and continues to grow. </p>

      <p>In 1990, American Indians had the highest rate of admission (their rate fluctuates more dramatically because of the relatively low numbers applying). Hispanic students had the second-highest rate of admission, more than 5 percent above the overall rate, and white students had the <i>lowest</i> admission rate.</p>
      <p>By 2000, however, black and Hispanic students faced admission rates far lower than the overall rate, with white and Asian students trading places for the highest admission rate. While the highest admission rate, for Asian students, was only about 2 percent greater than the overall rate, the lowest admission rate, for black students, was 18 percent below the overall rate. The rate for Hispanic students had fallen to about 5 percent <i>below</i> the overall rate. These changes could be traced to the 1996 ban on affirmative action in the admissions process.</p>
      <p>By 2014, Asians had outpaced white students for the highest admission rate, 9 percent above the overall rate. Black students' rate continued to be about 17 percent below the overall rate, and Hispanic students' rate also was about 7 percent below the overall rate.</p>

            <p>Data is for California resident freshmen, and thus can be effectively compared to the demographics of California. The UC has used different racial and ethnic categories since 1990. For this analysis, Chicano and Latino were counted as Hispanic; Asian American, Filipino American and East Indian/Pakistani were counted as Asian; African American was counted as Black; and Other and Unknown were counted as Other.</p></small></dd>

        <dd><small>
            <p>from the National Center for Education Statistics</p>
            <p>Students identifying as two or more races were counted as Other. The racial breakdown of high school graduates would be a better comparison than the demographics of California, but this data has historically not been collected. Still, the racial breakdown of high school graduates matches well with that of California as a whole.</p>

            <p>The Census is collected only every ten years, so the Census Bureau produces intercensal estimates, which were used to calculate the proportion of each race in the California population. These shouldn't be taken as precise, but are a good indicator of the changing demographics of California. Statistics for 1990 were taken directly from that year's Census. Statistics for 2014 were taken from the vintage year 2013 postcensal estimate. Residents identifying as two or more races were counted as Other. Only non-Hispanic residents were counted for White, Asian, Black, and American Indian.</p>
