      <h1>Race in UC Admissions</h1>

      <p class="lead">In 2014, the University of California <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/21/latino-white-uc-admissions_n_5187943.html" target="_blank">made news</a> by accepting more Latino than white applicants, a first since the university's founding almost a century and a half ago.</p>
      <p>Race is a common theme in dialogue about the university's application and admission process. Debate over affirmative action still seems fresh, in spite of California's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_209" target="_blank">Prop. 209</a>, which banned consideration of race in the university's selection process. The passage of Prop. 209 in 1996 prompted a decrease in the number of black and Latino students admitted to the university, the legacy of which is still felt at the university's 10 campuses today.</p>
      <p>Eighteen years later, we look back on almost 25 years of historical application and admissions data to determine how the makeup of the university's student body has changed, tracking the evolution of answers to fundamental questions: <a href="#applying">Who applies</a> to the University of California? <a href="#admitted">Who gets in</a>?</p>

      <p class="lead">The racial breakdown of UC applicants and admitted students has changed dramatically since 1990, but it's largely kept pace with demographic shifts in California.</p>

      <p>In 1990, when white people made up 57 percent of California's population, about half of the UC's applicants were white. In 2014, only 39 percent of California's residents are white, and, similarly, only about 25 percent of the UC's applicants were.</p>
      <p>Recently, more Hispanic students are applying and getting in. Though they made up 26 percent of California's population in 1990, they represented only 13 percent of UC applicants. In 2014, Hispanics made up 33 percent of the UC's applicants &mdash; more than any other group. Black applicants have made more modest gains: They made up about 7 percent of the population in 1990 but less than 5 percent of applicants, while in 2014, they represented about 6 percent of the population and 6 percent of applicants.</p>
      <p>Asian students have made up a disproportionately large section of the applicant pool since 1990, when they were already more than 25 percent of applicants. They have since grown to over 30 percent of applicants.</p>
      <p>According to state graduation data, Asian students made up almost 18 percent more of UC applicants than high school graduates in 2009, the only racial group that represented more of the applicant pool than of high school graduates. Hispanic students, in particular, made up far less of the applicants than graduates &mdash; five years later, however, this difference is less dramatic.</p>

      <p>Much of the change in the breakdown of UC applicants, then, has occurred as Hispanic students made up more of each year's high school graduates and applied to the university in greater numbers. White students have seen the opposite trend, while Asians have applied in consistently high proportions. </p>
